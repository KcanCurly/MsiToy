# Info
This repo has a msi file to play around with LPE and showcases how LPE could be possible. Install the msi file as admin, run "msiexec /fa MSIToy.msi" as standard user. Don't forget to uninstall after playing.

# Possible LPEs
- DLL is loaded from C:\Users\Public\msitoy_test.dll to showcase LPE can be done using dll load functionality if standard user has write access to the given file.
- Exe is run from C:\Users\Public\msitoy_test.exe to showcase LPE can be done using dll load functionality if standard user has write access to the given file.
- https://duckduckgo.com is opened with a web browser, browser will run as SYSTEM so you can open cmd.exe to get LPE.
- CMD is opened, and since its opened as SYSTEM you get LPE

# TO DO
- Create GUI for repairing and showcase functionality on that GUI can lead to LPE such as opening windows settings as SYSTEM or opening web browser as SYSTEM
- Add a credential access somewhere to showcase credential exposure
